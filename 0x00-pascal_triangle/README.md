# Pascal's Triangle Function

## Overview

This Python function, `pascal_triangle(n)`, generates Pascal's triangle up to the nth row and returns a list of lists of integers representing the triangle.

### Functionality

- The function takes a single parameter `n`, an integer representing the number of rows in Pascal's triangle to generate.
- If `n` is less than or equal to 0, the function returns an empty list.
- The function assumes that `n` will always be an integer.

## Usage

To use the `pascal_triangle` function:
1. Copy the function into your Python environment or script.
2. Call the function with the desired value of `n` to generate Pascal's triangle up to the nth row.

### Example

```python
result = pascal_triangle(5)
print(result)
```

This example will generate Pascal's triangle up to the 5th row and print the resulting list of lists. Replace `5` with any positive integer to obtain Pascal's triangle up to that row.
